Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the incorrect format. The program produces
  'Enter the key:' before givin the keys. Also the heys are in lowercase.
  Example:
$ java Driver < testcase.txt
Enter the key:
5468617473206D79204B756E67204675
e232fcf191129188b159e4e6d679a293

Style:

- Correct indentation

- Good block comments

- Both methods, aesRoundKeys and aesRcon, have no method header. Each function
  must have a comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes
  each parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example,
  but feel free to adapt it for javadoc (using @s):
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- When searching the Sbox or Rcon you are constantly parsing integers. Perhaps
  it would be more efficient to have them as integers already and save
  constantly parsing.

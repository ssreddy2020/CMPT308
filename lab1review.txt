Summary:

- The summary has poor quality.
 
- You did not submit a .pdf file on iLear, so I could not check the originality
  of your work. -2pts


\LaTeX:

- Good usage of equations.

- When writing \LaTeX, try to keep every line of text within 80 characters or
  100 at the most, then continue in a new line, \LaTeX will continue if you
  break lines.

- The usage of figures is incomplete. Usually figures have a caption that
  describes the content of the figure. What you are doing is simply add a
  picture with \includegraphics, but you needed to add a figure.
